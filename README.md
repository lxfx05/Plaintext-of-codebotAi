## 📌 What You'll See

### 🧠 Idea 1 — CodeBot Project Overview
A minimal offline AI assistant that:
- Explains code
- Detects and fixes errors
- Generates code from natural language prompts

Includes:
- Project goals
- Tech stack
- File structure (tree view)

### 📁 Idea 2 — Full Tree View
A detailed breakdown of a more advanced offline AI development environment, including:
- Backend with FastAPI and local LLM integration
- Modular code checkers for multiple languages
- Frontend components and assets
- Scripts, logs, and documentation structure

## 🛠️ How It Works

The HTML page is fully static and runs in your browser. No JavaScript frameworks, no external APIs — just clean HTML, CSS, and a bit of JS for tab switching.

You can use this as a reference for building your own offline AI tools or as a UI template for presenting project architectures.
